	  <feature optional="YES">
		<name>Martial Archetype: Cavalier (UA)</name>
		<text>The archetypal Cavalier excels at mounted combat. Usually born to nobility and raised in a royal court, a Cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging witty repartee at a state dinner.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>This Martial Archetype is from Unearthed Arcana: Kits of Old, and as such may not be allowed in your game. Consult your DM before selecting this option.</text>
	  </feature>
	  <feature optional="YES">
		<name>Cavalier: Bonus Proficiencies</name>
		<text>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion. You can choose to gain one tool proficiency in place of one skill proficiency.</text>
	  </feature>
	  <feature optional="YES">
		<name>Cavalier: Born to the Saddle</name>
		<text>At 3rd level, you have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount, you always land on your feet if you are capable of taking actions. Mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.</text>
	  </feature>
		<slots optional="YES">0,4</slots>
	  <feature optional="YES">
		<name>Cavalier: Combat Superiority</name>
		<text>At 3rd level, you gain a set of abilities that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>Superiority Dice:</text>
		<text>	You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
		<text>	You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>Using Superiority Dice:</text>
		<text>	You can expend superiority dice to gain a number of different benefits.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>• When you make a check to influence or control a creature you are riding, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the check. You apply this bonus after making the check but before learning if it was successful.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>• When you make a weapon attack against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the attack roll. You can use this ability before or after making the attack roll, but before any of the effects of the attack are applied.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>• When you make an attack with a lance while mounted, you can expend one superiority die to add it to your damage roll. In addition, the target of the attack must make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>• If either you or your mount is hit by an attack while you are mounted, you can expend one superiority die as a reaction, adding the number rolled to your or your mount's AC. If the attack still hits, you or your mount take half damage from it.</text>

		<text>At 7th level, you gain additional benefits when you use superiority dice to increase your damage when you attack with a lance. You can expend up to two superiority dice on the attack, adding both to the damage roll. If you spend two dice, the target has disadvantage on its Strength saving throw to avoid being knocked prone.</text>
